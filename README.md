# Arrested Development Game

https://robotsinboxes.github.io/arrested-development_quiz/

Project Goals:

* Create a quiz game based on the TV show, Arrested Development

* When the Start Quiz button is clicked, the first question and multiple choice options populate on the screen

* When the user chooses an option, it will display "Correct!" or "Incorrect" and move on to the next question.

* Incorporate a timer - if the timer runs out, the user sees the results page that tells them the game has been lost

* When the game is over, the user will be able to add their initials to the scoreboard, which will diplay the top three best scores
